    <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ri Lichtenstein is a grumpy old grad student studying for his MArch at the Rhode Island School of Design. He doesn't do much social media, so you can't follow him on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or GoopDrop. But if you write to him via snail-mail he will certainly write back to you and perhaps even draw you a little picture, and if you bump into him on the street, assuming his head is not lost in the clouds and that he sees you, he is sure say hello and greet you with a smile.</p>
