    <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>nspiration for this nubile bottle of wine is wrapped around an older vintage, called <i>Garden of Eden</i>. This was itself largely cribbed from a cropped portion of Rousseau's <i>Repast of The Lion,</i> which was used to depict an Edenic background of telluric primitivism. This prelapsarian backdrop for a bottle of wine is appropriate, since the Tree of Knowledge was, according to one Talmudic commentator, a grape. The 'forbidden fruit' of this oenophilic landscape is the double entendre that Eve's Secret subtly seeks to explore, cleverly disguised in its memetic camouflage borrowed from lingerie-brand Victoria's Secret. This may seem unnecessarily salacious and not very architectural at all, but while a dramatic, primitive-hut creation story is featured in almost every architectural treatise from Vitruvius to Le Corbusier, there is no primitive hut in Biblical Eden.The nearest thing we have to a protective structure are the proverbial fig leaves and their heavenly replacements - the garments divinely bequeathed to Adam & Eve. The association of fabric with primitive structure begins to sound alarmingly like heavenly support of Gottfried Semper's primitive hut as postulated in the pages of <i>Der Stil</i>. Luckily, these primeval suits were not woven in Semperian fashion but were made from skin taken from that old phallic symbol, the Serpent of the garden – according to midrashic exegesis. If we stich together various biblical glosses, the Ednic wardrobe seems to have been passed on to Noah (who planted an antediluvian vineyard) and eventually to Jacob, who gave it to his son Joseph in the form of a now-woven ketonet passim, or striped coat. The keen-eyed reader will note that I have taken the liberty of draping said garment over a bit of the frontispiece to Marc-Antoine Laugier's second edition of his <i>Essai sur l'Architecture</i> and that these stripes happily coincide with Victoria Secret's own signature bifurcated background.</p>
